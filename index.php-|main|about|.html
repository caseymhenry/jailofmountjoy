		<p><font size = "1"><font color="white"> "Reading <em> Finnegans Wake </em> is far more like like learning a language:  one unconsciously inculcates background material while focusing upon odd nuclei of sense, which are due to aggregate at some future date" - Roland McHugh, <em>Annotations </em>, v. </font></p>

<p><font color="white">The poet makes himself a seer by an immense, long, deliberate derangement of all the senses." - Rimbaud. </font></p>

<strong><font size = "2"> <font color="white"><div style="width: 600px; margin-left: 150px;">

<p>         The possibility that <i>Finnegans Wake</i> is simply an eternal dream, dreamed by a singular all-man dreaming for all eternity, makes one decisive moment of climax difficult to render.  There are instead moments of "micro-climax," or, rather, the clipped and abbreviated lines of formerly recognizable songs, melodies, and prayers melded by Joyce’s into his famously dense <i>Wake</i>an prose.  Bits of recognizable music are obscured, however, by the layered registers of meaning and allusion in the <i>Wake</i>.  And yet Joyce’s musical ear—as easily attuned to the sound of a complexly orchestrated libretto as to the trickle of urine in a barroom toilet—makes its way even into the arrangement and clusters of these levels of allusion.  By palimpsestic burying, rhythm is left intact beneath even the most heavy accumulation of terms and phrases—a prayer in Sanskrit obscured beneath a glue advertisement, an "Our Father" mixed with both the Egyptian god Osiris and a prosaic department store.  </p>

<p>        As such, this project seeks to restore Joyce’s simpler rhythms and musicality by rendering the intentionally crafted waves of reference into an easily perceptible aural dimension—an aurality Joyce kept in mind throughout the book’s writing.  I achieve this, technically, by playing the different level of reference musically.  Through such a process, crescendos become revealed that weren’t originally discernible, and Joyce’s amplifying and relieving the text’s density reveals a dramatic movement all its own.  This subconscious drama in the language is further amplified by critical conception of the <i>Wake</i> as a dream dreamt by its chief character HCE. If we take Joyce at this word that the shifting levels of linguistic density are synchronized to the rhythms of sleep, rendering these shifts in a simple way becomes integral. Therefore, <i>Jail of Mounty</i> frames aurally the stages of sleep paired by Joyce to stages of the book, both the frantic drama of an REM cycle and the more passive periods of deep sleep.  To fully illustrate this concept, Book Two represents the descent into twilight,  Book Three the progression from twilight to midnight, and Book Four the movement back towards dawn. To show this progression in miniature, <i>Jail of Mountjoy</i> samples such a timeframe accordingly.</p>

<p>        The intent of this project, then, is to make the rhythms hidden beneath the language visible by showing the changes and fluxes in linguistic "thickness”—that is, the density of thought and "night-language" as the night itself unfolds.  My primary text for Joyce’s references is Roland McHugh’s <i> Annotations to Finnegans Wake</i>, already arranged spatially almost like sheet music. I also expand McHugh’s categorizations for the different types of references, and align each category to a different octave. Listeners can then hear what type of reference is occurring at each moment. (Categories include "Professional Jargon," "Linguistic [Taxonomic],” and "Geographic," for example.) When a <i>Wake</i>an word references a category within its respective line of <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, a note from its corresponding octave will ring, resulting in chance melodies and combinations.  McHugh’s original conception of linking two lines of annotation to a single line of the <i>Wake</i> has been observed; I then have broken down the line of the <i>Wake</i> into a single second.  Thus, a 35 line segment of the segment “Issy’s Night Lessons,” for instance, becomes a 17.5 second composition.  The intent of the music is that, very much like John Cage’s own intentionally chaotic "Roaratorio" and "The Merry Widow of Eighteen Springs,” based <em>Wake</em> excerpts, and the generative collisions taking place in the borrowed text, new, unforeseen combinations will occur in the resonances and rhythms of Joyce’s “night” music.  Conversely, listeners will note how certain affective elements, designed by Joyce, but difficult to discern in his famously enigmatic, <i>Wake</i>an language, are more clearly represented and heightened in sound.  For example, the simple-toned longing of ALP—at the book’s end a river returning again to the abundant origin of the Ocean—is represented in a trillingly monotone sequence that evokes the isolation of the great Flood, the whisper of the communicationally impaired lover, and the simple tones of exhaustion.  </p>

<p>        <i>Jail of Mountjoy</i> aims to both formally explicate certain opaque elements of the <i>Wake</i> intended by Joyce, while taking Joyce’s initiative to yield new and predictable results from the potentially endless combinations contained in his singularly dense and allusive language.
