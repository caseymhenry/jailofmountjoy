<p>         <i>Finnegans Wake</i> is a text marked by music, yet this simple fact has long been obscured by the forbidding layering of Joyce’s prose. A text that should be appreciated for its lyrical assonance and rhythms is regarded as a notorious symbol for impenetrability and displeasure. Anyone who has heard Joyce read   the novel’s ending can appreciate the book’s integral aural component; anyone appreciating Joyce’s penchant for bawdy limericks, and glee in the coarse double-entendre of naming a book of poetry (<i>Chamber Music</i>) after the “music” of a chamber pot, can understand his desire for unconventional music. </p>

<p>Roland McHugh’s <i>Annotations to</i> Finnegans Wake aligns this musicality with Joyce’s experimentation in referentiality and linguistic layering by arranging his annotations spatially, such that they resemble sheet music. <i>Jail of Mounty</i> takes this logic a step further by literally playing the annotations as music. I accomplish this by creating larger categories of references—-e.g. "Professional Jargon," "Linguistic [Taxonomic],” "Geographic”—-and aligning each category to a respective octave. Readers can then perceive, aurally, when certain references are being invoked, and their density. As McHugh breaks a single line of the <i> Wake </i> into two lines of annotations, I have translated each line from the <i>Wake</i> into a second-long interval, in order for the resulting sound to be legible.</p>

<p>Further, the questions of density, and its easy perceivability, is one at heard of understanding the book’s construction. As is by now canonical, Joyce how <i>Ulysses</i> was a book of the day, and <i>Finnegans Wake</i> a book of the night, with all unclarities implied by this nocturnal state (Ellmann, James Joyce, 1983, pg 590). Critics such as John Bishop have cemented the reality of the <i> Wake</i> as mimetically presenting the course of a night, and the book’s correlated frenzy of linguistic density, amalgamations, and increased impenetrability as representing the brain’s passage from REM to deep sleep. <i>Jail of Mountjoy</i> sampled from the books of the <i>Wake</i> accordingly to illustrate this passage of dream states sonically; one can make in a clearer fashion the density, and related brain state, of Joyce’s “night music” (as Anthony Burgess reflects in Re-Joyce).</p>

<p>Chance combinations—so long at the heart of artists engaging with Joyce’s work—will also occur, yielding new and unforeseen harmonies and melodies. In this case I take the initiative from John Cage’s intentionally chance-based "Roaratorio" and "The Merry Widow of Eighteen Springs.” Also, users will find certain almost subliminal, and certainly sub-textual, figurative dimensions to Joyce’s use of referential density. When the light begins to emerge in the <i>Wake</i>’s final book, where the mythological female figure ALP is returning from river to ocean, the aching lucidity and thinness of sound reiterate thematic elements of the work: the exhausted tones of a lover, the great stillness of a Biblical-level flood and oceanic expanse.</p>
